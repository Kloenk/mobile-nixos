== Device-specific note

Using `fastboot` to burn system.img to the userdata partition will fail.

It seems like it flashes successfully like other devices do, but the flashed
image will not boot.

The current workaround is to `fastboot boot` TWRP and use `dd` through `adb` to
flash the image.

```
 $ cat .../.system.img | adb shell dd of=/dev/block/by-name/userdata bs=8m
```
